        <div class="content">
            <div class="textBx">
                <p>I am passionate about working on real-world probelms that have the potential
                    to impact the lives of others. I love using technology to bring products into the market that have a remote
                    possibility of changing things for the better. I pride myself in being a extremely curious individual. My latests
                    interests include web development, iOS development, and relational database tehcnologies. <br />
                <br />
                    I have a thirst for results and priceless values that my parents instilled in me. I put my team first 
                    and pay immense attention to detail. I belive that competence is important but doubling down on one's 
                    strength more beneficial. I've spent majority of my life moving around the country and in some cases, countries. 
                    Some might assume that it is not ideal, however, I found it be a great learning experience. I feel blessed to have 
                    met various groups of people with different backgrounds so young in my life.
                    I belive it really helped me shape my perspective and views.

            <h2> Career </h2>
            <p> I'm actively seeking opportunities in Product Management and/or Software Engineering roles. <br />
            <br /> 
            I deeply care about the following: <br />
            <br />
            1) The project I'm working on <br />
            2) Th purpose of the company <br />
            3) The people I'm working with <br />
            <br />
            I'm not afraid of taking on challenging tasks, in fact, I gear into my zone when working on big and complex problems. 
            I'm also extremely comfortable with asking any and all question that come to my mind regardless of how 
            "silly" they may seem.

            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <p> Table Tennis has always been a part of my life since High School. I'm glad to have served as a offcier and 
                presdient for the Table Tennis Club here at IU! Leading the club has been extremly challenging yet crucial 
                as a learning experience for me. I met some of my closest friends here. I have to admit, I am extremely competitive when it comes to
                collegiate tournaments. 
                <br /> <br />
                I recently found interests in Hackathons. Especially since they are remote, the opportunity to meet/work with others
                who attend different schools is too good to give up. I am also a member of code@IU, the club helped me meet my peers
                who also major in CS!
