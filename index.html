        <div class="content">
            <div class="textBx">
                <p>I am passionate about working on real-world problems that impact the lives of others. I aspire to use technology to being products to market that will change the world for the better.
                    I pride myself in being a curious individual. 
                    My latest interests include web development, iOS development, and relational database technologies. <br />
                <br />
                    I have a thirst for results and priceless values that my parents instilled in me. I put my team first 
                    and pay immense attention to detail. I believe that competence is important but doubling down on one's 
                    strength more beneficial. I've spent majority of my life moving around the country, and in some cases, countries. 
                    Some might assume that it is not ideal; however, I found it be a great learning experience. I feel blessed to have 
                    met various groups of people with different backgrounds so young in my life.
                    I believe it really helped me shape my perspective and views.

            <h2> Career </h2>
            <p> I'm actively seeking opportunities in Product Management and/or Software Engineering roles. <br />
            <br /> 
            I deeply care about the following: <br />
            <br />
            1) The project I'm working on <br />
            2) Th purpose of the company <br />
            3) The people I'm working with <br />
            <br />
            I'm not afraid of taking on challenging tasks, in fact, I'm in my zone when working on challenging and complex problems. 
            I'm also comfortable with asking any and all question that come to my mind regardless of how 
            "silly" they may seem.

            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <p> Table Tennis has always been a part of my life since high school. I'm glad to have served as an officer and 
                president for the Table Tennis Club here at IU! Leading the club has been extremely challenging yet it's also been a crucial 
                learning experience for me. I met some of my closest friends here. I have to admit, I am extremely competitive when it comes to
                collegiate tournaments. 
                <br /> <br />
                I recently found interests in Hackathons. Especially since they are remote, the opportunity to meet/work with others
                who attend different schools is too good to pass up. I am also a member of code@IU, the club helped me meet my peers
                who also major in CS!
